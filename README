download and extract v-rep, e.g. into /opt/vrep
www.v-rep.eu

- remove the following comments from remoteApiConnections.txt in the v-rep directory (/opt/v-rep)
portIndex1_port                 = 19998
portIndex1_debug                = true
portIndex1_syncSimTrigger       = false

- start v-rep by v-rep.sh

- load /scence/youbot_arm

- start the simulation


compile:
 $ cmake <path_to_CMakeLists.txt> -DVREP_DIR:PATH=<path_to_v-rep>

example
 $ cd RobotManipulation
 $ mkdir build
 $ cmake .. -DVREP_DIR:PATH=/opt/v-rep
 $ make

start the example:
 $ ./example



### PYTHON

you need to add the python modules to you python path, e.g.

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/v-rep/programming/remoteApiBindings/python/python

and the shared object library to you LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/v-rep/programming/remoteApiBindings/lib/lib/64Bit^C


if python do no find the module or the library, you can simply copy the files into your working directory
